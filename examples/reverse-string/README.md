## Reverse String

The reverseString function takes a string **str** as input and reverses it using the two-pointer approach. It first converts the string into an array of characters to make the swapping process easier. Two pointers, left and right, are initialized at the beginning and the end of the string, respectively. It then repeatedly swaps the characters at the positions indicated by the pointers until left is no longer less than right.

Finally, the array is converted back to a string, representing the reversed version of the original input, and this reversed string is returned. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as it needs to perform swaps on half of the characters in the string.
